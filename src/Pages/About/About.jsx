              <p className="about-text">Hi, my name is Mohamed Talbi, and Iâ€™m a self-taught Web developer witha passion for building interactive user interfaces.I began my journey learning web development from scratch, sifting through different open-source resources on Youtube, Medium, MDN, and a lot more. I came across some difficult moments along the road, but with strong dedication and hard work I managed to circumvent them all, which made my way up to become an experienced developer. In that time, I made it my goal to practice every concept I learned in a personal side project by building multiple front-end solutions including landing pages, portfolios, and cloning some websites.These projects made me develop skills regarding clean design, learning UI/UX bestpractices, and gaining solid experience working with front-end technologies like Html,Css, javascript, and Reactjs.</p>
